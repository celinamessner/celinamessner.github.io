### ðŸš— Nested Dictionary with Car Class

This Python script showcases how nested dictionaries can be used within an object-oriented program. A `Car` class is created to store and manage information about different cars using a nested dictionary structure. The program demonstrates how to interact with the dictionary using built-in methods like `.items()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()` to efficiently access and display car data.
