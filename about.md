## About

Hi, my name is Celina. I'm co-founder and CTO of clare&me. clare&me develops clinical AI: Conversational APIs for Behavioral Health.
I quit my job at Google to dedicate my life to digitzing the mental healthcare industry in order to increase coverage for mental health support.

## What drives me

I believe mental health support should be accessible to all. With a demand 12x higher than the available mental health support, I believe technology is a driving factor in bridging that gap.
